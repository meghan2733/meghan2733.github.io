								</span>
								<p>
									I was raised in Jalgaon, <strong>(21.0042° N (latitude) and 75.5639° E (longitude) for GIS geeks) </strong> 
									a quaint town nestled in the western region of Maharashtra, India.
									My early education included completing high school and earning an Associate's degree in Jalgaon.
									Subsequently, I relocated to Pune, Maharashtra—commonly referred to as the 'Oxford of the East'—to pursue
									a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology. I had a natural affinity for memorizing the names of countries
									and their capitals, nurturing a keen curiosity about geography.
								
								<br/><br/>
								I have very broad range technological experience ranging from Pro*c to HTML5. <strong>Python</strong>
								is my favourite programming language though simply because of mandatory indentation. 
								I enjoy tackling programming challenges, particularly debugging and deconstructing code, followed by reassembling
								and refining it. The process of identifying issues and implementing solutions keeps my problem-solving skills sharp
								and fuels my passion for coding.

									<strong><li>Site Suitability analysis for Managed Aquifer Recharge</strong>
									<p>
										This project's main focous was groundwater recharge and identifying
										merit of site. Groundwater recharge depends on several parameters such
										as soil characterstics, precipitation levels, Geography and so on.
										<br/>
										The state of Texas was selected as Study area and data was collected 
										from several different resources such as <a href="https://tnris.org/" target="_blank">TNRIS.</a>
										<br/>
